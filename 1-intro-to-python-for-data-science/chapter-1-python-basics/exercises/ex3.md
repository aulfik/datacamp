#  Any comments?

```
Exercise ID 14025
```

##  Assignment 

Something that Hugo didn't mention in his videos is that you can add **comments** to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the `#` tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment in the editor, `# Division`; it is completely ignored during execution.

##  Instructions 

Above the `print(7 + 10)`, add the comment 

```
# Addition

```



```
# Division
print(5 / 8)


print(7 + 10)
```

##  Hints 

For this exercise you only have to add one line of comments. It won't run as Python code. Add `# Addition` right above `print(7 + 10)`.



##  Solution 

```
# Division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition
print(7 + 10)
```
