00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Congratulations!

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.160
You've now covered the basics of using pandas.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.160


4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.160


5
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.960
In chapter 1, you saw how to subset and sort DataFrames and how to add new columns.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.960


7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.960


8
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.760
In chapter 2, you saw several methods for aggregating and grouping data to calculate summary statistics.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.760


10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.760


11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.120
In chapter 3, you saw how using indexing and slicing allows for simpler subsetting.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.120


13
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.120


14
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:36.120
In chapter 4, you saw how to visualize a DataFrame, and how to read data from and write data to CSV files.

15
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.120


16
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.120


17
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.360
I hope you are convinced that pandas is a powerful tool to analyze tabular data.

18
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.120
In fact, pandas is so powerful that there are many features that we didn't get around to discussing in this course.

19
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.120


20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.120


21
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.240
To begin with, everything in this course involved a single

22
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.400
DataFrame, but sometimes you need to join or "merge" several DataFrames together.

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.400


24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.400


25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.920
Reading from CSV files barely scratches the surface of the options for importing data into pandas.

26
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.920


27
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.920


28
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.000
You can also perform very sophisticated exploratory data analysis using pandas.

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.120


30
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.120


31
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.720
Congratulations, and have fun learning!
