00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So far, you've been calculating summary statistics for all rows of a

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.560
dataset, but summary statistics can be useful to compare different groups.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.480


4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.480


5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.680
While computing summary statistics of entire columns may be

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.040
useful, you can gain many insights from summaries of individual groups.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.040
For example, does one color of dog weigh more than another on average?

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.000
Are female dogs taller than males?

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.120


10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.120


11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.680
You can already answer these questions with what you've learned so far!

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.680


13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.680


14
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.920
We can subset the dogs into groups based on their color, and take the mean of each.

15
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.720
But that's a lot of work, and the duplicated code means you can easily introduce copy and paste bugs.

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.720


17
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.720


18
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.520
That's where the groupby method comes in.

19
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.640


20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.640


21
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.120
We can group by the color variable, select the weight column, and take the mean.

22
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.760
This will give us the mean weight for each dog color.

23
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.760


24
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.920


25
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.120
This was just one line of code compared to the five we had to write before to get the same results.

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.120


27
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.120


28
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.720
Just like with ungrouped summary statistics, we can use the agg method to get multiple statistics.

29
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.320
Here, we pass a list of functions into agg after grouping by color.

30
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.280
This gives us the minimum, maximum, and sum of the different colored dogs' weights.

31
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.280


32
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.280


33
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.720
You can also group by multiple columns and calculate summary statistics.

34
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.400
Here, we group by color and breed, select the weight column and take the mean.

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.600
This gives us the mean weight of each breed of each color.

36
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.600


37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.120


38
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.320
You can also group by multiple columns and aggregate by multiple columns.

39
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.320


40
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.320


41
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.160
Now that we've talked about grouping, it's time to practice grouped summary statistics.
